UUIDs in R
================

This is a walkthrough of how you can use UUIDs in R from my twitter
[@neilgcurrie](https://twitter.com/neilgcurrie).

A universally unique identifier is a string of numbers and letters. They
are extremely useful in data and databases, and look like this:
‘a1bf3f2c-fd6a-4ec5-8afd-299214c63739’. Firstly, let’s look at examples
of adding an ID to data.

It’s often a good idea to have an ID field that you can use to
distinguish rows or cases in your data. This makes data wrangling and
linking much easier. There are different ways to do this.

One approach is to combine columns. Imagine you have a dataset of
customer details. You create an id field by combining name and date of
birth variables. But two customers could have the same name and date of
birth. What if they change their name? This is not ideal.

``` r
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

customers <- tibble::tribble(
  ~full_name,     ~date_of_birth, ~postcode,
  "Tobias Funke",  "1964-04-04",  "G42 7RY",
  "Buster Bluth",  "1970-10-30",  "G1 8QP",
  "Kitty Sanchez", "1975-07-20",  "G12 2LT",
  "Buster Bluth",  "1970-10-30",  "G55 5AD"
  )

customers1 <- dplyr::mutate(customers, 
                            id = paste0(full_name, "_", date_of_birth))

print(customers1)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   full_name     date_of_birth postcode id                      
    ##   <chr>         <chr>         <chr>    <chr>                   
    ## 1 Tobias Funke  1964-04-04    G42 7RY  Tobias Funke_1964-04-04 
    ## 2 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G1 8QP   Buster Bluth_1970-10-30 
    ## 3 Kitty Sanchez 1975-07-20    G12 2LT  Kitty Sanchez_1975-07-20
    ## 4 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G55 5AD  Buster Bluth_1970-10-30

Another approach is sequential. You create an id from 1 to n depending
on the row. In small examples this might be ok. But what if your data is
big? This becomes impractical or impossible. What if someone else is
updating the data too? This is where UUIDs come in.

``` r
customers2 <- mutate(customers, id = 1:n())

print(customers2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   full_name     date_of_birth postcode    id
    ##   <chr>         <chr>         <chr>    <int>
    ## 1 Tobias Funke  1964-04-04    G42 7RY      1
    ## 2 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G1 8QP       2
    ## 3 Kitty Sanchez 1975-07-20    G12 2LT      3
    ## 4 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G55 5AD      4

The most common forms of UUIDs use a combination of your machine’s MAC
address, random characters, and a timestamp. The clever part is that you
don’t need to know prior UUIDs to be confident a new one is unique. Why
is that?

It comes down to probability theory. Wikipedia has a good example

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>

To have a 50% chance of at least 1 collision you would need to have 2.71
quintillion UUIDs. This number is so big you would need to create a
billion UUIDs each second for 85 years!

So how do you use them in R? Luckily there is a great package called
uuid that makes it easy.

``` r
library(uuid)

# No time component

customers3 <- mutate(customers, id = uuid::UUIDgenerate(n = n()))

print(customers3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   full_name     date_of_birth postcode id                                  
    ##   <chr>         <chr>         <chr>    <chr>                               
    ## 1 Tobias Funke  1964-04-04    G42 7RY  a1d732ba-4a48-4826-b01e-e0b28f02c2e3
    ## 2 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G1 8QP   7cab79df-832a-4e67-8f44-d5161ecbe339
    ## 3 Kitty Sanchez 1975-07-20    G12 2LT  6db51a58-2be1-4520-a7b3-f1df202fb546
    ## 4 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G55 5AD  22be3d13-8884-4f06-9f35-7525f513724d

``` r
# With time component

customers4 <- mutate(customers, id = UUIDgenerate(use.time = TRUE, n = n()))

print(customers4)
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   full_name     date_of_birth postcode id                                  
    ##   <chr>         <chr>         <chr>    <chr>                               
    ## 1 Tobias Funke  1964-04-04    G42 7RY  2b006e9c-db4b-11ec-a74e-7e842d79ef29
    ## 2 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G1 8QP   2b006eb0-db4b-11ec-a74e-7e842d79ef29
    ## 3 Kitty Sanchez 1975-07-20    G12 2LT  2b006eb1-db4b-11ec-a74e-7e842d79ef29
    ## 4 Buster Bluth  1970-10-30    G55 5AD  2b006eba-db4b-11ec-a74e-7e842d79ef29

One thing to be aware of is memory. Each UUID takes up 128 bits. If
storage space is a major issue then another approach might be more
efficient. In most cases though this is not an issue.
