How to use R with SQLlite
================

This is a walkthrough of how you can use SQLite with R from my twitter
[@neilgcurrie](https://twitter.com/neilgcurrie).

Often in R we read in files of mixed formats. This gets messy fast and
when the data is too big R will lag or fall over. Enter the database.
SQLite is software used to interact with databases and is one of the
most popular engines around. We can work with SQLite directly from R.

Let’s create a database. We need the DBI and RSQLite packages to
interact with our database. The dbConnect function creates a connection
to a database when you supply a file name. When no database exists it
creates a blank one. This one is created in my working directory.

``` r
library(DBI)     
library(RSQLite)

filename <- glue::glue("{here::here()}/football-data.db")

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), filename)

DBI::dbListTables(con)
```

    ## character(0)

Now we add some data to our database. In this example I have taken
football (soccer) results data from football-data.co.uk for the Premier
League and La Liga. We use the dbWriteTable function to create new
tables with specified names and write the data all in one step.

``` r
library(readr)

# Create a table

epl_2122 <- readr::read_csv("https://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2122/E0.csv", 
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

DBI::dbWriteTable(con, name = "england_premier_league", value = epl_2122)

dbListTables(con) 
```

    ## [1] "england_premier_league"

``` r
# You can look at a tables fields

DBI::dbListFields(con, name = "england_premier_league")
```

    ##   [1] "Div"       "Date"      "Time"      "HomeTeam"  "AwayTeam"  "FTHG"     
    ##   [7] "FTAG"      "FTR"       "HTHG"      "HTAG"      "HTR"       "Referee"  
    ##  [13] "HS"        "AS"        "HST"       "AST"       "HF"        "AF"       
    ##  [19] "HC"        "AC"        "HY"        "AY"        "HR"        "AR"       
    ##  [25] "B365H"     "B365D"     "B365A"     "BWH"       "BWD"       "BWA"      
    ##  [31] "IWH"       "IWD"       "IWA"       "PSH"       "PSD"       "PSA"      
    ##  [37] "WHH"       "WHD"       "WHA"       "VCH"       "VCD"       "VCA"      
    ##  [43] "MaxH"      "MaxD"      "MaxA"      "AvgH"      "AvgD"      "AvgA"     
    ##  [49] "B365>2.5"  "B365<2.5"  "P>2.5"     "P<2.5"     "Max>2.5"   "Max<2.5"  
    ##  [55] "Avg>2.5"   "Avg<2.5"   "AHh"       "B365AHH"   "B365AHA"   "PAHH"     
    ##  [61] "PAHA"      "MaxAHH"    "MaxAHA"    "AvgAHH"    "AvgAHA"    "B365CH"   
    ##  [67] "B365CD"    "B365CA"    "BWCH"      "BWCD"      "BWCA"      "IWCH"     
    ##  [73] "IWCD"      "IWCA"      "PSCH"      "PSCD"      "PSCA"      "WHCH"     
    ##  [79] "WHCD"      "WHCA"      "VCCH"      "VCCD"      "VCCA"      "MaxCH"    
    ##  [85] "MaxCD"     "MaxCA"     "AvgCH"     "AvgCD"     "AvgCA"     "B365C>2.5"
    ##  [91] "B365C<2.5" "PC>2.5"    "PC<2.5"    "MaxC>2.5"  "MaxC<2.5"  "AvgC>2.5" 
    ##  [97] "AvgC<2.5"  "AHCh"      "B365CAHH"  "B365CAHA"  "PCAHH"     "PCAHA"    
    ## [103] "MaxCAHH"   "MaxCAHA"   "AvgCAHH"   "AvgCAHA"

``` r
# Create another table

ll_2122 <- read_csv("https://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2122/SP1.csv", 
                    show_col_types = FALSE)

dbWriteTable(con, name = "spain_la_liga", value = ll_2122)

dbListTables(con)
```

    ## [1] "england_premier_league" "spain_la_liga"

Imagine we want to add an extra season of Premier League data to our
table england_premier_league. Again, we use the dbWriteTable function
but now we use the option append = TRUE.

``` r
epl_2021 <- readr::read_csv("https://www.football-data.co.uk/mmz4281/2021/E0.csv",
                            show_col_types = FALSE)

dbWriteTable(con, name = "england_premier_league", value = epl_2021, 
             append = TRUE)
```

Now we have some data in there let’s query the database. We can send a
SQL query from R to the database and pull the queried data back into R.
We type SQL code as a normal string and pass it to the dbGetQuery
function.

``` r
query <- "SELECT Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG
          FROM   england_premier_league"

football_data1 <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, statement = query)

head(football_data1)
```

query <- "SELECT Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG

football_data2 <- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, statement = query)

head(football_data2)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">

This is really powerful. This data could be far too big for R to handle
all at once - no problem with this approach. You would only need the
memory to handle the queried, and hopefully smaller, dataset.

What if you don’t know SQL? You can use the dbplyr package with all the
great syntax you are familiar with from dplyr! R will turn your R code
into SQL code and send it to the database without needing to know any
SQL.

``` r
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dbplyr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

football_data3 <- con |>
  dplyr::tbl("england_premier_league") |>
  dplyr::select(Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG) |>
  dplyr::filter(FTHG + FTAG > 2.5)

head(football_data3)
```

<div data-pagedtable="false">

<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["Date"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["HomeTeam"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["AwayTeam"],"name":[3],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["FTHG"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["FTAG"],"name":[5],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Man United","3":"Leeds","4":"5","5":"1"},{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Burnley","3":"Brighton","4":"1","5":"2"},{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Chelsea","3":"Crystal Palace","4":"3","5":"0"},{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Everton","3":"Southampton","4":"3","5":"1"},{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Watford","3":"Aston Villa","4":"3","5":"2"},{"1":"14/08/2021","2":"Norwich","3":"Liverpool","4":"0","5":"3"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>

</div>

footballdata3 isn’t quite the same as a normal tibble/data.frame. That’s
because R hasn’t pulled the data in yet. This keeps things fast. To pull
it in we use the collect function.

``` r
football_data3 <- dplyr::collect(football_data3)
print(football_data3)
```

    ## # A tibble: 384 × 5
    ##    Date       HomeTeam   AwayTeam        FTHG  FTAG
    ##    <chr>      <chr>      <chr>          <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 14/08/2021 Man United Leeds              5     1
    ##  2 14/08/2021 Burnley    Brighton           1     2
    ##  3 14/08/2021 Chelsea    Crystal Palace     3     0
    ##  4 14/08/2021 Everton    Southampton        3     1
    ##  5 14/08/2021 Watford    Aston Villa        3     2
    ##  6 14/08/2021 Norwich    Liverpool          0     3
    ##  7 15/08/2021 Newcastle  West Ham           2     4
    ##  8 21/08/2021 Leeds      Everton            2     2
    ##  9 21/08/2021 Man City   Norwich            5     0
    ## 10 23/08/2021 West Ham   Leicester          4     1
    ## # … with 374 more rows

``` r
football_data2 |> 
  dplyr::as_tibble() |> 
  identical(football_data3) # exactly the same
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
# remember to close your connection to the database

dbDisconnect(con) 
```
